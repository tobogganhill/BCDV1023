Blockchain Integration

I suggest you use VS Code to edit the files.

Start Ganache to create a local Ethereum blockchain to run your code against.
Use Remix to compile ToDo.sol.
Copy the ABI and paste it into config.js.
Use Remix to deploy the smart contract to Ganache.
Copy the address where the contract has been deployed. Paste the address into config.js.

Enable the 'Live Server' extension in VS Code.
Open index.html with Live Server. Your browser should launch with the dApp displayed and ready to interact with.
